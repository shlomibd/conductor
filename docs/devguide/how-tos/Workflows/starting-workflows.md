# Starting Workflows

In Conductor, workflows can be started using the Conductor UI, APIs, or SDKs.

## Using Conductor UI

The Conductor UI is useful for sandbox testing before deploying the workflows to production using the APIs or SDKs.

**To start a workflow:**

1. Go to [Workbench](http://localhost:8127/workbench) in the Conductor UI.
2. Select the  **Workflow Name** and **Workflow version**.
3. If required, provide the workflow inputs in **Input (JSON)**.
4. (Optional) Specify the **Correlation ID** and **Task to Domain (JSON)** for the execution.
5. Select the â–¶ icon (Execute Workflow) at the top to run the workflow.

Once the workflow has started, you can view the ongoing execution by selecting the Workflow ID hyperlink in the **Execution History** side panel on the right.

## Using APIs

You can start workflow executions using the Start Workflow API (`POST api/workflow/{name}`). `{name}` is the placeholder for the workflow name, and the request body contains the workflow inputs if any.

### Example using cURL

In this example, a cURL request is used to invoke the workflow `sample_workflow` with the input `service`  specified as `fedex`.

```bash
curl '{{ server_host }}/api/workflow/sample_workflow' \
  -H 'accept: text/plain' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"service":"fedex"}'
```

## Using SDKs

Conductor offers client SDKs for popular languages which have library methods for making the Start Workflow API call. Refer to the SDK documentation to configure a client in your selected language to invoke workflow executions.

### Example using JavaScript

In this example, the JavaScript Fetch API is used to invoke the workflow `sample_workflow` with the input `service`  specified as `fedex`.

```javascript
fetch("{{ server_host }}/api/workflow/sample_workflow", {
    "headers": {
        "accept": "text/plain",
        "content-type": "application/json",
    },
    "body": "{\"service\":\"fedex\"}",
    "method": "POST",
});
```
