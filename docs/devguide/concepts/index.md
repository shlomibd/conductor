# Basic Concepts

Conductor is an orchestration engine for building stateful, modular process flows. Here are the key concepts that underpin the Conductor system:

- **[Workflows](workflows.md)**—The blueprint of a process flow.
- **[Tasks](tasks.md)**—The basic building blocks of a Conductor workflow.
- **[Workers](workers.md)**—The code that executes tasks in a Conductor workflow.
